It sounds like you may have a cold or flu. The best thing to do is to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If your symptoms don't start to improve after a few days, or you experience any other unusual symptoms, it's best to see a GP for a diagnosis. Would you like some more ideas that could help?

Yes please

You can try using a humidifier or steam inhalation to help soothe your throat and reduce congestion. You should also avoid smoking, as it can make your symptoms worse. Eating a healthy, balanced diet and getting plenty of sleep can also help you to feel better. Would you like any more advice?

No that's all thank you

No problem. Take care and feel better soon!
